Hello :smile:, If you are on this webpage you are interested to know about me :blush:. Should you choose to read further -- 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Physics Discipline at the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar (IITGN) - India. I work in the field of Complex Networks. In particular, I am trying to understand the temporal changes in structure and dynamics of scientific collaboration networks. I am also interested in problesm related to non linear dynamics, Agent Based Modelling of complex systems. Recently I have a new found interest in looking for Machine Learning applications in the field of Network Science. 

I developed my interest in Network Science during my Masters. The diverse applicability of tools and methods from Network Science to a wide spectrum of real world problems is what motivates me the most. To the best of my knowledge, field of Complex Networks is the best example of highly collaborative and interdisciplinary fields of study. Not only does it lets us take up challenging problems, it has also helped in expanding the frontiers of research in many domains. 

Most of my motivation and enthusiasm to do research is due to consistent support and ecouragement from my teachers in all phases of my Academic career. For that, I am forever thankfull to all my teachers.

## Personal 

I was born and brought up in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh -- one of the northern states in India. Apart from academics, sports have been a major part of my life all along. The first sport I learnt was Field Hockey. Cricket, Basketball and Volleyball are my other favourite sports. Most important things that I have learnt from sports are Endurance, Courage and Team-work. I am also a big time foodie (I feel if I was ever under interrogation good food would be my weakness :blush:). Travelling, Playing Board Games and Running are other activities I am interested in with a recent attempt to learn cooking.
