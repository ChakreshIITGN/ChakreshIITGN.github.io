Hello :smile:, 

I began my academic career in Physics with a Bachelors (University of Delhi) and Masters (IIT - Kanpur). With deep interest in non-linear systems I kept exploring potential problems to pursue my Ph.D and attended various gathering and schools. This led me to the Santa-Fe Complex Systems Winter Schoole at IISER Mohali, which was a pivotal moment for me as I was introduced to the field of complex systems and network science. 
Since then I have developed a keen interest in quantitative as well as qualitative problems related to complex data-sets leveraging my expertise in statistical analysis/modelling, graph-theory, probability theory and machine learning. Over the years, I have developed strong programming skills in python and gained expertise in its modern data science stack (numpy, pandas, nltk, spacy, networkx, seaborn scikit-learn etc). To keep myself synchronised with the latest technological trends I have earned certifications in Machine Learning, Deep-Learning, Generative-AI, Big Data analytics and MLOPs. To improve my soft-skills I took courses in Project Management and Business Intelligence which has greatly helped me understand the translation of technical insights into business needs and prepared me well for challenging roles. 

## A little personal :

I was born and brought up in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh -- one of the northern states in India. Apart from academics, sports have been a major part of my life all along. The first sport I learnt was Field Hockey. Cricket, Badminton and Table-tennis are my other favourite sports. Most important things that sports have taught me are endurance, courage and team-work. 

I am also a big time foodie. Trying out different cuisines/dishes from all around the globe, with a soft corner for Indian food, is my plan on most weekends. I also love to cook food and have mastered some Indian curries and desserts. 

Travelling, board games and running are other activities I am always up for. 

PS: If you want to know any secrets ... take me out for a great coffee :P
