Hello :smile:, 

Currently I am a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Paris and work in the Interaction Data Lab at Learning Planet Institute (LPI, former CRI) Paris. I did my Ph.D. in Physics discipline at the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar (IITGN) - India. I work in the field of complex networks and science of science. In particular, I use statistical methods to study temporal dynamics of the evolution od scientific fields and that of corresponding collaboration networks. 

I developed my interest in complex systems and network science during my masters. The diverse applicability of tools and methods from these fields to a wide spectrum of real world problems is what motivates me the most. The study of complex systems is among highly collaborative and interdisciplinary fields of study that provides opportunities to work on challenging problems. 

## Personal 

I was born and brought up in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh -- one of the northern states in India. Apart from academics, sports have been a major part of my life all along. The first sport I learnt was Field Hockey. Cricket, Basketball and Volleyball are my other favourite sports. Most important things that sports have taught me are endurance, courage and team-work. 

I am also a big time foodie. Trying out different cuisines/dishes from all around the globe, with a soft corner for Indian food, is my plan on most weekends. I also love to cook food and have mastered some Indian curries and desserts. 

Travelling, board games and running are other activities I am always up for.
