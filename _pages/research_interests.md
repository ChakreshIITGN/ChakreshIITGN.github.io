On a macroscopic scale I am fascinated by the study of complex systems and under it, the networks. I mention below key topics/areas of my interest that I have either worked on, or plan to do in the future. 

* Quantitative studies of temporal networks and their community structures

* Interdepences across layers in a multi-layered network system

* Dynamical processes on networks

* Generative models for complex networks 

* Agent Based Modelling

* Game theoretic models for interactions in complex systems
