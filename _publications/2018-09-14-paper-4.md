excerpt: 'In this work, we extract functional brain networks using coherence measures on EEG recordings of film clips from popular Indian Bollywood movies representing nine Rasas in the Indian Natyasastra. Structural and functional network measures were computed for these brain networks, averaging over a range of significant edge weights, in different brainwave frequency bands. We identify segregation of neuronal wiring in the brain into modules using a community detection algorithm. Further, using mutual information measure, we compare and contrast the modular organizations of brain network corresponding to different Rasas. Hubs identified using centrality measure reveal the network nodes that are central to information propagation across all Rasas'
