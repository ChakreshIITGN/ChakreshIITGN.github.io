excerpt: 'In this work, we extract functional brain networks using coherence measures on EEG recordings of film clips from popular Indian Bollywood movies representing nine Rasas in the Indian Natyasastra. Structural and functional network measures were computed for these brain networks, averaging over a range of significant edge weights, in different brainwave frequency bands.'
