excerpt: 'In this work, we have studied the collaboration and citation network between Indian Institutes from publications in American Physical Society (APS) journals between 1970–2013. We investigate the role of geographic proximity on the network structure and find that it is the characteristics of the Institution, rather than the geographic distance, that play a dominant role in collaboration networks'
