excerpt: 'In this study we explore the interdependence between evolving citation and co-authorship networks focused on the publications, by Indian authors, in American Physical Society journals between 1970 and 2013. We record interactions between each possible pair of authors in two ways: first, by tracing the change in citations they exchanged and, second, by tracing the shortest path between authors in the co-authorship network.'
