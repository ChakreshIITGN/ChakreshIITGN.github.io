This talk was focussed on Statistical Mechanics of Complex Networks. The motive of the talk was to highlight and appreciate the robustness of Statistical Mechanical methods in the field of Complex Networks. I mainly discussed the following paper (https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.70.066117) and some other interest aspects of Complex Networks when viewed from a physicist's perspective
